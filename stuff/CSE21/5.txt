Method Overloading: a class have multiple methods by same name but different parameters.

Example: 
	class calculation{
	sum(int a, int b);
	sum(int c);
	}
	
	...
	calculation j = new calculation();
	j.sum(1,1);
	j.sum(1);

In the first j.sum, it inizalizes 2 varaibles and so it will go to the first sum because it fits the parameters of two int varibles. 
The second j.sum will inizalize the second sum because it's parameters are just one integer.
