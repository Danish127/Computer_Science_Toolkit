For Loop:
A continuous and reiderating source code that cycles infinitly until it fulfill tha set conditions.
There are three parts to a for loop.
initialization, termination,incrementation.

initialization is where you create a varible unique to that for loop.
Termination is the conition that will allow the for loop to stop once the temination condition is met.
Incrementation is after the first loop ends, there is a incrementation factor that increase the inzilization varible.
	
	Example:
		for( int i = 0, i < 4, i++)
			System.out.print("John Laurnes");
		As along as i < 4, it will keep printing out John Laurens. However the incrementation factor increase teh inzilization varible by ++ or by one.  

Array:
An array is a container object that holds a fixed number of values of a single type.
