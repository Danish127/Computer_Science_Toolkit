Input/Output Fundamentals:

Input is any information that is needed by your program to complete ts execution.
Output is any information that the program must convey to the user.

Pay close attention to the arrangement of an user input, if a varible is called that required an user input, it will return an error or not run at all. 
One can not execute a argument if all its variable are undetermined and does not exist.

When it comes to outputs, know what you want. Make sure appropriate parameters are assigned before exicuting program or you will run into a logical error in which the code works but not to the sepcificity of the user or client. 

-Hints-
System.in is an input stream which is connected to keyboard input of programs.
System.out is a PrintStream, it outputs the data you write to it to the console.
