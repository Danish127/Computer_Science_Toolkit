MIPS is a fundamental part of C and coding in general because it is literally the last layer before binary.
MIPS is an assembly language that follows very strict restrictions however all these restrictions make up every single code ever conceived.

Format:
There are three formats R, I, J.

R: opcode, rs, rt, rd, shamt, funct.
I: opcode, rs, rt, immediate
J: opcode, address

Opcode, indicates what operations is needed and is called.
rs, indicates the first variable or values
rt, represent the second.
rd, represent where the answer of the two goes, most of the time.
shamt, the amount that needs to be shifted
funct, what function is being called.
