Pointers:

A pointer is a variable which contains the address in memory of another variable. 
We can have a pointer to any variable type.

However pointers are one of the most difficult and widely confusing parts of C because of their nature.
The idea of a pointer to a pointer stops a lot of people in their track.
But remember that pointers are almost regular referring and being used in terms of an Array.
